- set proper window dimensions
- Setup a "selected day" and show day/month/year in top right section

NOT FIXED/ABANDONED:
- fix DB connecting with each Day object loaded
- Fix vertical & horizontal scrolling for side section (frame4)
- Top right option menu:
    1. Add balance
    2. Clear Database
    3. Export (?)
- Graph: close graph before generating new one
